**1** See CharacterReader code.

**2** Form of the if-else-if ladder:
    
	if (a == b){
		// do something
	else if(a == c){
		//do something else
	} 
	else{
		//Default thing to do if none of the above conditions are met
	}
   
**3** The last else associates with the second if statement

**4** For loop counting from 1000 to 0 by -2:
	
	for (int i = 1000; i >=0; i = i-2){

	}
	
**5** No, this isn't valid as i will be out of scope.

**6** Break allows us to exit a loop and to go to a specific named block

**7** "After While" will be displayed as we have broken out of the while loop, but are still within the scope of the for loop.

**8** The loops will print out the following
	
	01
	23
	45
	67
	89
	
**9** See Java For Loop Increments Class

**10** See CharacterReader Class

**11** An infinite loop is a loop which cannot terminate due to its constraints being unachievable or unchanging and so the loop will keep running forever.

**12** Yes, the break must be within a block enclosing the break.
