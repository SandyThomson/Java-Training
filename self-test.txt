Chapter 8 self test

  1. 
 
  2. Namespaces prevent collisions between class names
  
  3. Packages are stored in directories
  
  4. Protected access allows access within the same package and subclasses in other packages.  Default access allows only access within the same package.
  
  5. Members of a package can be used by other packages by use of the import keyword, or specifying their fully qualified name.
  
  6. The ... interface?
  
  7. There is no limit to the number of classes which may implement an interface.  A class can implement any number of interfaces.
  
  8. Interfaces can be extended.
  
  9. See IVehicle.java
  
 10. Variables declared in an interface can be shared with other parts of a program, but it's controversial, apparently.
 
 11. A package is essentially a container for classes.
 
 12. java.lang is imported automatically into a program.
 
 13. The default keyword is, surprisingly, used to declare a default interface method.
 
 14. It is possible to define a static method in an interface as of JDK 8.
 
 15. The reset() method can be added to the interface with a default implementation which throws an exception.  This ensure that existing code which implements the interface does not break,
     and no preexisting code will be expecting reset() to exist and so will not see the error.
