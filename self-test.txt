Chapter 7 self test answers

 1. A superclass does not have access to members of a subclass, but the subclass can access any non-private members of the superclass.

 2. class Circle extends TwoDShape{
      Circle() {
        super();
      }

      Circle( double d ) {
        super( d, "circle" );
      }

      Circle( Circle c ) {
        super( c );
      }

      double area() {
        return 3.14159 * ( getWidth() / 2 ) * ( getWidth() / 2 );
      }
    }

 3. Prevent a subclass from accessing a superclass member by declaring it as private.

 4. super( params ); - calls the constructor of the superclass
    super.membername; - access a member of the superclass

 5. Descending hierarchical order - Alpha, Beta, Gamma

 6. The type of the object being referred to determines which version of an overridden method is called.

 7. An abstract class is a class in which at least one abstract method - i.e. a method which has no implementation and must be overridden.

 8. The final modifier prevents a method from being overridden or a class from being inherited.

 9. Inheritance, method overriding and abstract classes support the "one interface, multiple methods" concept by allowing
    us to create general class structure with a consistent interface that is shared by all subclasses.

10. The Object class is a superclass of all other classes.

11. True.

12. The final keyword is used to create a named constant.
