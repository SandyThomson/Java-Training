 1. `count` is private to the X class and so cannot be directly accessed directly from the Y class.

 2. An access modifier must _precede_ a member’s declaration.
 
 3. See StackDemo.java

 4. void swap( Test t1, Test t2 ) {
  int tmp = t1.a;
  t1.a = t2.a;
  t2.a = tmp;
}

 5. The return type does not form part of the method signature so both methods have the same sig, which is invalid.

 6. See BackwardsDemo.java
 
 7. Shared variable must be declared as static
 
 8. A static block can be used to execute some code before any objects are created, e.g. for initialisation.

 9. An inner class is a class which is nested inside another class
 
10. To make a member accessible by only other members of its class, the private modifier must be used.

11. The name of a method plus its parameter list constitutes the method’s signature.

12. An int argument is passed to a method by using call-by-value.

13. See Sum.java

14. A varargs method can be overloaded.

15. int foo( int a, int ... n ) {}
    int foo( int ... n ) {}
