Chapter 8 Self Test

  1.  Using the code from Try This 8-1, put the ICharQ interface and its three implementations into a package called qpack. Keeping the queue demonstration class IQDemo in the default package, show how to import and use the classes in qpack.
      - Done


  2.  What is a namespace? Why is it important that Java allows you to partition the namespace?
      - Seperation and isolation of areas of code. You can have classes/methods named the same in different namespaces.


  3.  Packages are stored in ______________.
      - A directory structure????


  4.  Explain the difference between protected and default access.
      - Default: only provides access within your current
      - Protected: allows access such as public, but only withing the same apckage.


  5.  Explain the two ways that the members of a package can be used by other packages.
      - Importing that package/class, or refering to the required element by fully qualified name.


  6.  “One interface, multiple methods” is a key tenet of Java. What feature best exemplifies it?
      - Ask me after chapter 17.


  7.  How many classes can implement an interface? How many interfaces can a class implement?
      - As many as you like for either case.


  8.  Can interfaces be extended?
      - Yup.


  9.  Create an interface for the Vehicle class from Chapter 7. Call the interface IVehicle.
      - Done


  10.   Variables declared in an interface are implicitly static and final. Can they be shared with other parts of a program?
      - Sure, in the same way other static instance variables can be.


  11.   A package is, in essence, a container for classes. True or False?
      - Sure.

  12.   What standard Java package is automatically imported into a program?
      - "Java.lang".


  13.   What keyword is used to declare a default interface method?
      - "default".


  14.   Beginning with JDK 8, is it possible to define a static method in an interface?
      - Yes


  15.   Assume that the ICharQ interface shown in Try This 8-1 has been in widespread use for several years. Now, you want to add a method to it called reset( ), which will be used to reset the queue to its empty, starting condition. Assuming JDK 8 or later, how can this be accomplished without breaking preexisting code?
      - providing a "default reset(..." method in the interface.


  16.   How is a static method in an interface called?
      - "interface.method".
