   Chapter 7 Self Test

  1.  Does a superclass have access to the members of a subclass? 
        - None at all
      Does a subclass have access to the members of a superclass?
        - Completely (unless the supercalss has marked elements as private)

  2.  Create a subclass of TwoDShape called Circle. Include an area( ) method that computes
the area of the circle and a constructor that uses super to initialize the TwoDShape portion.
        - See "Question2.java"

  3.  How do you prevent a subclass from having access to a member of a superclass?
        - Setting memebers as private in the supercalss.

  4.  Describe the purpose and use of the two versions of super described in this chapter.
        - Use super as the 1st statement in a constructor, as a call to the superclass contructor.
        - Use super.memeber, as direct reference to methods (that may have been overridden 
          by the subclass) in the super class.

  5.  Given the following hierarchy:
class Alpha { ...
class Beta extends Alpha { ...
Class Gamma extends Beta { ...
  
  In what order do the constructors for these classes complete their execution when a Gamma
object is instantiated?
        - Alpha, Beta, Gamma.

  6.  A superclass reference can refer to a subclass object. Explain why this is important as it
relates to method overriding.
        - pollymorphisum. ie, you get when run, the methods of the subclass.

  7.  What is an abstract class?
        - (.h file equiverlent) A template that defines methods that need to be implemented by a subclass.

  8.  How do you prevent a method from being overridden? 
        - prefix the method defenition with 'final'
      How do you prevent a class from being inherited?
        - prefix the class defenition with 'final'

  9.  Explain how inheritance, method overriding, and abstract classes are used to support
polymorphism.
        - Err...

  10.   What class is a superclass of every other class?
        - Object

  11.   A class that contains at least one abstract method must, itself, be declared abstract.
True or False?
        - Yup

  12.   What keyword is used to create a named constant?
        - Final
