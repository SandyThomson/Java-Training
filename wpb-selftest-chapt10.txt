Chapter 10 Self Test
  1.  Why does Java define both byte and character streams?
      - Because it forgot about them in the original implementations


  2.  Even though console input and output is text-based, why does Java still use byte streams for this purpose?
      - Due to Q1, lots of code relys upon gthese standard streams being byte streams.


  3.  Show how to open a file for reading bytes.
      - "FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream( filename );"

  4.  Show how to open a file for reading characters.
      - "BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader( newFileReader( filename ) );"

  5.  Show how to open a file for random-access I/O.
      - "RanomAccessFile file = new RandomAccessFile( filename, "rw" );"

  6.  How can you convert a numeric string such as "123.23" into its binary equivalent?
      - "Double.parseDouble("123.23");"

  7.  Write a program that copies a text file. In the process, have it convert all spaces into hyphens.  Use the byte stream file classes. Use the traditional approach to closing a file by explicitly calling close( ).
      - TODO

  8.  Rewrite the program described in question 7 so that it uses the character stream classes. This time, use the try-with-resources statement to automatically close the file.
      - TODO

  9.  What type of stream is System.in?
      - "byte input stream."

  10.   What does the read( ) method of InputStream return when the end of the stream is
reached?
      - "-1"

  11.   What type of stream is used to read binary data?
      - "InputStream";

  12.   Reader and Writer are at the top of the ____________ class hierarchies.
      - "Character Streams"

  13.   The try-with-resources statement is used for ___________ ____________ ____________.
      - "closing opened files"

  14.   If you are using the traditional method of closing a file, then closing a
      - "true".
