1.  Bytecode is the product of the Java compiler.  It is a hardware-agnostic optimised
    version of the Java code, ready for execution by the JVM.  It's important in the
    context of Internet programming because it is portable and provides a relatively
    high level of security.

2.  The three main principles of OOP are:
      Encapsulation:
        Data and the code which acts upon it are bundled together into a single object.
      Polymorphism:
        The same interface may be used to interact with multiple objects of different types.
      Inheritance:
        An object may adopt the properties of another object without explicitly defining them.

3.  Java programs begin execution with the main() method.

4.  A variable is a name for a memory location which can be assigned a value.

5.  "67count" is not a valid variable name - they must not start with a number.

6.  // This is a single-line comment

    /*
      This is a
      multi-line
      comment
    */

7.  a) if ( condition ) { statement(s) }
    b) for ( initialisation; condition; iteration ) { statement(s) }

8.  A block of code is enclosed in braces

11. A typing error while entering a program will result in a syntax error.

12. Functionally, it does not matter where on a line you put a statement, so long
    as it is correctly terminated.  However, consistently indented code is significantly
    more human-readable and easier to maintain so it's a good idea.
