Q1: A class is the set of instructions required to construct an object of that type. 
    An object is an instantiation of a class and exists in memory.  
    
Q2: A class is defined using the keyword class

Q3: Each object has its own copy of the instance variables.

Q4: MyCounter counter
    counter = MyCounter.new();
    
Q5: public double myMeth(int a, int b) { }

Q6: Via a return statement with the correct type of variable e.g.  return myVar;

Q7: the constructor method has the same name as the class.

Q8: new creates a new object/instance of a class including calling the constructor for that class.

Q9: Garbage collection is the method by which Java frees memory from objects/variables which are no longer in use by the program. 
    An object is deemed unused and eligible for garbage collection when there are no remaining references to that object.
    Garbage collection is performed at a time determined by the JVM and cannot be predicted in advance by the programmer.
    finalize is a method which is called whenever an object is garbage collected.
    As discussed above the programmer cannot predict in advance when or indeed if finalize will be called.
    
Q10: This is a reference to the current object.

Q11: Yes.

Q12: void.
