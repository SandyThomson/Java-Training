1) primitives are strictly defined to ensure that they function exactly the same in all possible environments

2) chars are 16-bit representations of characters. Java differs from other languages in that it uses 16-bit rather than 8-bit lengths.

3) Boolean can only have the value true or false

4) System.out.println("One\nTwo\nThree");

5) sum is re-initialized in the loop, so it will only show value of last i

6) Prefix performs the increment before other operations ( like assignment ) while posfix before the increment after the assignment.

7) Using a shortcircuit operator means that if the first parameter satisfies the condition, then the second statement is not evaulated. This means that if the second statement can leads to a divide by zero error ( eg "a / b = c" ), then this can be prevented by having the first statement check the value of b is not zero and using the short circuit operator.

8) byte and short are promoted to int

9) A cast is needed when conducting narrowing operations ( i.e. long -> int ) where information may be lost.   

10) See code

11) Redundant parantheses do not afect performance

12) A block defines a scope.
