## Java Training - Chapter 7 Self Test

1) _Does a superclass have access to the members of a subclass? Does a subclass have access to the members of a superclass?_

2) _Create a subclass of **TwoDShape** called **Circle**. Include an **area()** method that computes the area of the circle and a constructor that uses **super** to initialize the **TwoDShape** portion._

4) _Describe the purpose and use of the two versions of **super** described in this chapter._

5) _Given the following hierarchy:_

class Beta extends Alpha { ...

class Gamma extends Beta { ...
```

_In what order do the constructors for these classes complete their execution when a **Gamma** object is instantiated?_

6) _A superclass reference can refer to a subclass object. Explain why this is important as it relates to method overriding._

7) _What is an abstract class?_

8) _How do you prevent a method from being overridden? How do you prevent a class from being inherited?_
