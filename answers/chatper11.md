### Chapter 11 Self Test

1) _How does Java's multithreading capability enable you to write more efficient programs?_

2) _Multithreading is supported by the            class and the               interface._

3) _When creating a runnable object, why might you want to extend **Thread** rather than implement **Runnable**?_

4) _Show how to use **join()** to wait for a thread object called **MyThrd** to end._

5) _Show how to set a thread called **MyThrd** to three levels above normal priority._

6) _What is the effect of adding the **synchronized** keyword to a method?_

7) _The **wait()** and **notify()** methods are used to perform                ._

8) _Change the **TickTock** class so that it actually keeps time. That is, have each tick take one half second, and each tock take on half second. Thus, each tick-tock will take one second. (Don't worry about the time it takes to switch tasks, etc.)_

9) _Why can't you use **suspend()**, **resume()**, and **stop()** for new programs?_

10) _What method defined by **Thread** obtains the name of a thread?_

11) _What does **isAlive()** return?_

12) _On your own, try adding synchronisation to the Queue class developed in previous chapters so that it is safe for multithreaded use._
