  1. Multithreading allows you to partition programs into work units/threads which can run in parallel. 
  This can make your program more efficient on a multi processor system, or when a thread is waiting for resources etc (another thread can run in that time). 
  
  2. Multithreading is supported by the Thread class and the Runnable interface
  
  3. You would extend Thread if you wanted to override a method of thread _other than_ `run()`
