1. No, a superclass does not have access to its subclass' members. Yes, a subclass has access to its superclass' non private members.

3. declaring members' private stops subclasses from accessing them

5. Alpha, then Beta, then Gamma

6. A superclass reference to a subclass object would only have access to the superclass' methods, even if these had been overridden by the subclass.

7. An abstract class is one that hasn't been fully defined, with the implication that subclasses will complete the definition.

8. Marking a method final prevents it from being overridden. Marking a class final prevents it from being inherited from.

9. Inheritance, method overriding and abstract classes help support the "one interface, many methods" philosophy aiding polymorphism.

10. The Object class

11. True, a class with an abstract method must be declared abstract. 

12. final is used to make named constants
