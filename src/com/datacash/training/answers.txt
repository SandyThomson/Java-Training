1) See SantasLists.java etc.

2) The namespace is a declarative region. By partitioning the namespace you can have multiple classes with different names so long as they are in different parts of the namespace.

3) Packages are stored in the file system 

4) Protected and default both allow all classes in the same package to access a variable/method, but protected additionally allows subclasses outside of the package to use the variable/method.

5) Members can either be referenced directly or imported. For example:

```java
int answer1 = package.Member.getAnswer();

import package.Member
int answer2 = Member.getAnswer();
```

6) Interfaces best exmplify the tenet, as they can be used to define common methods that every implementation must implement.

7) Any class can implement a method, and there is no limit on the number of interfaces a class can implement.

8) Interfaces can be extended.

9) See IVehicle.

10) Interfaces in a interface can be shared with other parts of the program.

11) True

12) java.lang is automatically imported

13) `default` is used to declare a `default` interface method

14) It is possible to declare a static interface method as of Java 8.

15) To add a new method to an interface without breaking existing implementations, a default implementation of the method must be supplied using the default keyword.

16) A static interface method is called using the interface name i.e. `Interface.method()`
