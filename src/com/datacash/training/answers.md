1) `Throwable` is at the top of the exception hierarchy.

2) A `try` block surrounds the code where an exception could be thrown. The `catch` block contains code that is executed when the error is thrown.

```java
try { 
	int i = 1/0;
} catch ( Exception e ) {
	System.out.println("Divided by zero!");
}
```

3) The `catch` lock does not have an associated `try` block, so an exception thrown by the code will not be caught.

4) If an exception is not caught it propagates up and the program terminates.

5) Because B extends A, catching exceptions of type A will also include all exceptions of type B, making the second `catch` block unreachable.

6) Yes

7) False. Finally is the last bit of code run after a try/catch block has completed execution, regardless of the outcome.

8) All exceptions except `RuntimeExceptions` must be declared in the throws clause.

9) `MyClass` does not extend `Throwable`, so it cannot be thrown.

10) Question10.java

11) An exception can be generated by a `throws` statement, or by errors in the JVM or the program.

12) The direct subclasses of `Throwable` are `Error` and `Exception`.

13) The 'multi-catch' feature allows multiple exceptions to be caught by a single `catch` statement.

14) `Error` exceptions should not be caught.
