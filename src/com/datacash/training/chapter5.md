1. ```java
double array[] = new double[12];
double[] array = new double[12];
```

2.```java
int[] array = {1,2,3,4,5};
```

3. See Question3.java

4. See Question4.java

5. `indexOf()` will return the first occurence of the target in the invoking String, while `lastindexOf()` will return the the last occurence.

6. `"I like Java".length()` and `"I like Java".charAt()`.

7. See Question7.java

8. Bitwise operators cannot be applied to the double class.

9. y = x < 0 ? 10 : 20;

10. It is a logical operator, as it is acting on boolean values.

11. Both these cases will cause an error, as the boundaries of an array are strictly enforced

12. >>>

13. See Question13.java

14. The for loops cannot be converted into for-each loops, as the loop control variables are required to assign values to the area when sorting. It is possible to do this when using Lists as demonstrated in Question 4, although it is not as efficient.

15. As of Java 7, switch statements can be controlled by a String.
