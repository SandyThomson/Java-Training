Chapter 4 Self Test

  1.  What is the difference between a class and an object?
      - A 'class' represents a plan for an eventual object. 
      - An object is an instantiation (the real manifisation) of the class design.

  2.  How is a class defined?
      - Using the 'class' keyword.

  3.  What does each object have its own copy of?
      - Class variables.

  4.  Using two separate statements, show how to declare an object called counter of a class called MyCounter.
      - MyCOunter counter;
      - counter = new MyCounter();

  5.  Show how a method called myMeth( ) is declared if it has a return type of double and has two int parameters called a and b.
      - double myMeth( int a, int b )

  6.  How must a method return if it returns a value?
      - With a "return <value>;" statement.

  7.  What name does a constructor have?
      - The same as the class.

  8.  What does new do?
      - Instantiate a new object, then run either the detault contrstuctor or the one defined by the programmer.

  9.  What is garbage collection, and how does it work? What is finalize( )?
      - The process where unused objects memory footprint is returned to the pool. Finalize() will be called for objects that are being garbage collected.

  10.   What is this?
      - A decleration that we are accessing the object copy of member variables (rather that local variables).

  11.   Can a constructor have one or more parameters?
      - Yup

  12.   If a method returns no value, what must its return type be?
      - void
