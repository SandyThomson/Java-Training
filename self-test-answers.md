Bytecode is an intermediary instruction set for execution by a virtual machine. It's important for internet programming
because it's portable (any machine with a Java virtual machine can run Java bytecode), and allows an extra layer of
security by restricting certain operations at runtime.

The main principles of OO programming are encapsulation (coupling related functionality and hiding implementation detail),
polymorphism (OO form of single dynamic dispatch, allows methods of different types to be triggered using a single
interface), and inheritance (allows types to be organised hierarchically, and share functionality).

I suspect this wants me to say the 'main' method, but technically the classloader will execute anything in a
static block before calling main.

A variable is a named location on the stack that can be assigned values and is enforced by a type at compile-time.

# 5

Only D, though B doesn't follow Java naming conventions.

# 6

Single line comment with a double forward slash, like this `//`
Multiline comment with a slash-asterisk asterisk-slash pair, like:

```java
/*
	Cooooommmmmeeeeeent.
*/
```

# 7

If:

```java
if ( condition )
	statement ;
```

For:

```java
for( initialization ; condition ; iteration )
	statement ;
```

# 8

Using curly braces, like this: 

```java
{
 doSomething();
 doAnotherThing();
}
```

See InchesToMeters.java (InchesToMetersFunWay.java for a one-liner).

# 11

Syntax error (at compile-time).

# 12

Not really, no.
