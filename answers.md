1. Two double arrays:

    ```java
    double firstArray[] = new double[12];
    double[] secondArray = new double[12];
    ```

2. Initialising a one-dimensional array

    ```java
    int thirdArray[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
    ```
    
3. See Average.java

4. See Sort.java

5. ``indexOf()`` returns the position of the first instance of a character in a String. ``lastIndefOf()`` returns
the position of the last instance.

6. String methods:

    ```java
    int stringLength = "I like java".length();
    char charAtFive = "I like java".charAt(5);
    ```
    
7. See Encode.java

8. Bitwise operators can't be used on doubles, only integer types.

9. Ternary operator:

    ```java
    y = ( x < 0 ) ? 10 : 20;
    ```
    
10. The & is a logical operator (non-short circuited) as bitwise operations can't be performed on booleans.

11. Array overruns and negative values will both produce errors.

12. ``>>>`` - Shifts all bits in an integer one place to the right, discarding the least significant bit and 
setting the most significant to 0 regardless of the sign.

13. See MinMax.java

14. Enhanced for loops could not be used for this Bubble sort as each element of the array is not operated on 
sequentially and once.

15. A String can control a switch as of Java 7.
