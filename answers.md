## Java Training - Chapter 5 Self Test

1) _Show two ways to declare a one-dimensional array of 12 doubles._

2) _Show how to initialise a one-dimensional array of integers to the values 1 through 5._

3) _Write a program that uses an array to find the average of 10 double values. Use any 10 values you like._

4) _Change the sort in Try This 5-1 so that it sorts an array of strings. Demonstrate that it works._

5) _What is the difference between the **String** methods of **indexOf()** and **lastIndexOf()**?_

6) _Since all strings are objects of type **String**, show how you can call the **length()** and **charAt()** methods on this string literal: "I like Java"._

7) _Expanding on the **Encode** cipher class, modify it so that it uses an eight-character string as the key._

8) _Can the bitwise operators be applied to the double type?_

9) _Show how this sequence can be rewritten using the **?** operator._

```
if (x < 0) y = 10;
else y = 20;
```

10) _In the following fragment, is the **&** a bitwise or logical operator? Why?_

```
boolean a,b;
// ...
if (a & b) ...
```

11) _Is it an error to overrun the end of an array? Is it an error to index an array with a negative value?_

12) _What is the unsigned right-shift operator?_

13) _Rewrite the **MinMax** class shown earlier in this chapter so that it uses a for-each style **for** loop._

14) _Can the for loops that perform sorting in the Bubble class show in Try This 5-1 be converted into for-each style loops? If not, why not?_

15) _Can a **String** control a **switch** statement?_
