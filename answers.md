1) A class is the abstract form of an object. An object is a concrete form of a class.

2) 
```java
class ClassName {

}
```

3) Instance variables.

4) 
```java
MyCounter counter = new MyCounter();
``` 

5)
```java
	public double myMeth( int a, int b ) {
	
	}
```

6) In order for a method to return from a method with a return value, it must return with a value.

7) The constructor has the same name as the class.

8) `new` will create an instance of a class, as an object.

9) Garbage collection will hoover up all objects that have dropped out of scope, and therefore cannot be used anymore. 
Nobody knows how garbage collection works. It has a mind of its own, but generally will run when there have been a lot of instance variables hanging around in memory not being used.

10) `this` is a reference to the instance the `this` is within.

11) A constructor can contain zero or more parameters.

12) The method must be declared with a `void` return type.
